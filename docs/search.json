What may seem like a legitimate excuse to you may not be considered one by us. What constitutes a legitimate excuse will be at the discretion of the lecturer, but includes such things as illness requiring a visit to the doctor; university-related travel; etc. You must provide proof for all legitimate excuses a note on official letterhead, signed by an appropriate authority: doctor, professor, etc. Even missing a test to attend a family- related event‚Äù must be proved by some form of documentation: a funeral notice, etc. Missing tests because you are late; your bike broke down; you missed the bus, or it ran late; the power went out and your alarm did not wake you (have a battery-powered back-up!); you had to study for another test; you were ill but did not see a doctor; etc., are not considered"

To maintain an engaged and collaborative learning environment, a minimum attendance rate of \\(80\\%\\) is compulsory. Attendance will be recorded during each class session. If we find that your attendance percentage falls below the required threshold due to extenuating circumstances, you must seek approval from your academic adviser. This approval is mandatory for participation in any examinations, including assignments. It is essential to communicate proactively with your adviser to discuss the reasons for any attendance issues and to devise a plan for catching up on missed coursework. Please note that exceptions will be considered on a case-by-case basis, with a strong emphasis on maintaining the integrity of the learning experience for all students."
